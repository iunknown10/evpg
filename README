libevpq is a library that allows libevent based applications to communicate 
to a pgsql database in a non-blocking manner. 

The goal of the project is to be easy to use along with transparent to the
calling application as possible. 

Utilizing within your application is simple:

1. initialize the configuration
   struct evpg_cfg *config;
   config = evpg_config_init();
2. Initialize libevent
   event_init();
3. Connect to your database one or more times
   for (i=0; i < number_of_connections; i++)
      evpg_connect(config, "dbname=whatever hostaddr=5.5.5.5")
4. Whenever a query needs to be made use evpg to make the query
   evpg_make_query(config, "SELECT * FROM DB", 
     (void *)application_callback_when_query_is_finished, userdata);

   Argument 1 is the evpg configuration,
   Argument 2 is the query you would like to perform
   Argument 3 is the callback function to call once the query has completed.
   Argument 4 is a pointer to data the callback function should be passed.

5. Profit.

There *are* bugs, I'm sure of it - there isn't much error checking right now,
but I am working on this.
